# CSE364 Software Engineering Individual Assignment

This repository contains the report and materials for the CSE364 Software Engineering Individual Assignment. The assignment focused on studying and evaluating automated test generation tools, specifically Randoop and Evosuite, using the Apache Lang open-source project.

## Instructions

The goal of this individual assignment was to study and experience the practicality and weaknesses of Randoop and Evosuite by detecting and localizing a bug in the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` class. The assignment was completed under the supervision of Instructor Mijung Kim.

### Report Contents

The report included the following sections:

## 1. Detect and localize a bug (50 points)

- Ran Randoop and Evosuite on the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` class.
- Attached a failing test case that manifests the bug, along with code and stack trace.
- Provided a code snippet indicating the bug location in the source code.
- Explained how the bug occurred and its root cause.
- Compared the bug detection between Randoop and Evosuite.

## 2. Measure coverage of generated tests (20 points)

- Measured the coverage of Randoop and Evosuite tests using Jacoco.
- Attached coverage reports for Randoop and Evosuite tests.

## 3. Describe strengths and weaknesses of Randoop and Evosuite (30 points)

- Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of Randoop and Evosuite based on the previous sections.

## 4. Improve Test Generation (20 points)

- Proposed ideas to address the weaknesses identified in Randoop and Evosuite.
- Discussed how the bug detection ability of Randoop and Evosuite can be improved.

### Usage

To reproduce the experiments and tests conducted in this assignment, follow the instructions provided in the "Randoop and Evosuite Tutorials" section. Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set as indicated and follow the steps for running Randoop and Evosuite.
